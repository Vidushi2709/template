            A curious little soul exploring all things AI, getting lost in books, and folding tiny paper worlds one crane at a time. When I&apos;m not dreaming with code or paper, you&apos;ll probably find me scribbling little stories about life or daydreaming about all the pink and glitter the world has to offer âœ¨ðŸ’–
